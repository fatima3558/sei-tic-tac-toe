# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.
